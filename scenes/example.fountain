INT. INKWELL EXAMPLE, DAY

Man, what an action slug we have here.
Dialogue begins with an all-caps name and something to say,
and scene headers like the one above start with INT. or EXT.,
(or with something else, just put a period before the name).
Anything else is considered an action slug, like this one.

CHARACTER
Hey, what about me?

BEN SCOTT
Oh, hello! You're a character, aren't you?

CHARACTER
Yeah, I sure am! And this is dialogue, huh?

BEN SCOTT
That's right!
