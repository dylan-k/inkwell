Inkwell is a little script which embeds screenplays in websites via the Fountain markup language.


An example of Inkwell in action:

{% include inkwell.html source="example" %}

Another example, this time with the screenplay written right in the file!

{% include begin-inkwell.html %}

INT. SNIPPET, DAY

Wow, what a snippet! This is written directly in the markdown!

READER
It is?

BEN SCOTT
That's right!

{% include end-inkwell.html %}
